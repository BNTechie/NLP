# Basic understanding in NLP

### What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing is an area of computer science concerned with interaction between computers and human languages. The primary aim is to enable a computer to process, understand, interpret and respond to human language in a meaningful way. This involves processing and analyzing large volumes of natural language data using computational techniques.

#### Applications of NLP in real life:

- **Text Classification:** Categorizing emails into spam or non-spam.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining whether a customer review is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Machine Translation:** Automatically translating text from one language to another, e.g., translating any text from English to Spanish.
- **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language into text, such as voice commands in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying proper names in text, such as names of people, organizations, or locations.
