# What is Spam Filtering?
Spam filtering is the process of identifying and filtering out unwanted, irrelevant, or harmful messages (spam) from a communication stream, typically emails or text messages. Spam filters aim to prevent spam messages from reaching the user's inbox or message stream while allowing legitimate messages to pass through.
